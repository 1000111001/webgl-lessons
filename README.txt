A series of simple lessons in WebGL, plus some related examples.

The folders named lesson01, lesson02, and so on are a sequential tutorial
and are best understood using the explanatory text at:

    <http://learningwebgl.com/>

The form of the lessons is *very* loosely based on NeHe Productions'
well-known OpenGL tutorial, which can be found here:

    <http://nehe.gamedev.net/>


The folders named example01 etc are example code for interesting
stuff outside the scope of the tutorial, and have their own README.txt
files with details.
